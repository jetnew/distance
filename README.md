## Distances

Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD)

* L1-norm
* Manhattan- or Taxicab-norm

Sum of Squared Difference (SSD)

* Squared L2-norm
* Euclidean norm
* Squared Euclidean distance

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

* 1/n * Sum of Absolute Difference

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

* 1/n * Sum of Squared Difference

Euclidean Distance

* L2-norm
* Natural distance in a geometric interpretation

Manhattan Distance

* L1-norm
* Sum of Absolute Difference
* Minkowski distance with p=1

Chebyshev Distance

* L-infinity norm
* Minkowski distance with p=infinity

Minkowski Distance

* Lp-norm

Canberra Distance

* Weighted Manhattan distance

Cosine Distance

* Dot product scaled by product of Euclidean distances from the origin
* Represents angular distance of 2 vectors, ignoring scale

Pearson's Distance

* Correlation distance based on Pearson's product-momentum correlation coefficient of 2 sample vectors
* Measures linear relationship between 2 vectors

Hamming Distance

* No. of entries in 2 vectors which are different
